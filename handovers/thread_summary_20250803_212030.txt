WHAT WE DID:
------------
1. ✅ Diagnosed Google Drive sync issues (API vs mount)
2. ✅ Pivoted to GitHub solution 
3. ✅ Created complete GitHub integration system
4. ✅ Built operational protocols and automation
5. ✅ Established working Claude Web ↔ Claude Code workflow

KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED:

- Push Script: ./scripts/push_to_github.sh
- Handover Generator: create_handover.py
- Protocol Document: CLAUDE_CODE_PROTOCOL.md

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Claude Web analyzes situation and formulates prompt

3. Execution pushed to GitHub automatically
4. Repo folder uploaded to Claude Web
5. Claude Web analyzes results and plans next step

CRITICAL NOTES FOR NEXT THREAD:
-------------------------------
- GitHub sync is WORKING (verified with test files)
- Upload repo folder to Claude for visibility

- Memory Service still needs cross-agent fix

QUICK START COMMANDS:
--------------------
# Generate new handover
python3 /Volumes/aya_SSD/aya_mission_control/create_handover.py
